# Flutter Learning Repository

## Preview
![First UI](first_ui.png)

This repository documents my hands-on learning process while studying Flutter and Dart.  
Instead of only following tutorials, I rebuild concepts by writing and modifying code daily.

## Goals
- Understand Flutter widget architecture
- Learn layout logic (constraints, alignment, nesting)
- Build small UI implementations from scratch
- Develop mobile development habits

## What I Practice Here
- MaterialApp & Scaffold structure
- Basic widgets (Text, Center, Container)
- Styling & TextTheme
- Layout positioning
- Hot reload workflow

## Project Structure
Each update represents a learning iteration, not a finished product.  
The repository evolves as I understand the framework deeper.

## Next Targets
- Stateless vs Stateful widgets
- Navigation & routes
- Lists & dynamic UI
- Simple app projects
